# a-fun-cooking-game
this is a random game I made in unity. if anyone sees this please comment. I don't think anyone besides the people I send this link will see it.
to play the game you need to:
1: download the filed.
2: put all the files in one folder.
3: enter the folder.
4: run the My project(2).exe file.
5: if windows says it could be malicious, click more info and then click run anyways
5: enjoy (theres no tutorial. figure it out yourself.)
